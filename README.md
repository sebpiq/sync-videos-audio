Quick start
==============

1. Get the code from the github repository. You can for example download the [following zip](https://github.com/sebpiq/sync-videos-audio/archive/main.zip)
2. Install [docker](Â https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your computer
3. Open your terminal, and navigate to the folder containing the unzipped code.
4. Prepare the docker image and volume : 
    - Build the image by running `docker build -t sync-audio-video .`
    - Create a volume to hold your media files by running `docker volume create media-volume`
5. Start the docker container by running :

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -p 8080:3000 \
    --mount type=volume,source=media-volume,destination=/code/www/media \
    --name sync-server \
    -t sync-audio-video
```

6. At this stage, the server should be running, but it doesn't have any media files to serve yet. To test that the server is indeed running, open a web browser to [http://localhost:8080/video.html](http://localhost:8080/video.html).

7. Prepare your media files. You need to extract the audio from the video, for now only `.mp4` is supported for video and `.mp3` for audio, so you need to convert the files if necessary. Place both files in a new folder, and name them `audio.mp3` and `video.mp4`.

8. Copy the media files to the running container, by running `docker cp <PATH_TO_FILES>/. sync-server:/code/www/media`. Replace `<PATH_TO_FILES>` with the path to the folder containing your media files. Do not forget to append `/.` to that path as it instructs docker to copy the files correctly.

9. Now open in your web browser one page for the video player : [http://localhost:8080/video.html](http://localhost:8080/video.html), and in another tab (or other device), a page for the audio player : [http://localhost:8080/audio.html](http://localhost:8080/audio.html) (if you are using another device, you need to replace `localhost` with the IP address of the computer that runs the server).

=====

- add offset for ScriptProcessorNode when used
- download audio by chunks
- save server state
- server restart
- client auto reconnect
- web audio polyfills + normalize prefixes
- mp3 VS ogg supported / mp4 VS webm
- start / stop / pause video, how does it affect the sync state
- drop-in video of your choice
- dockerize
- check time drift video and audio
- parametrize config : `export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)` REF : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19331497/set-environment-variables-from-file-of-key-value-pairs
